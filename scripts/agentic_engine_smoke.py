"""GPU multi-worker smoke for the AgenticRolloutEngine (LIN-522).

Boots a ``≥2``-worker DP slab of the agentic engine — each worker building its own
inner ``SGLangRolloutEngine`` (Qwen3-Instruct) + a ``ToolEnvironment`` + calculator —
wires the rank-0 coordinator (``set_workers``), and drives multi-turn rollout over a
batch of heterogeneous prompts. Proves the whole loop end-to-end: rank 0 fans the
batch into ``n × P`` single-trajectory tasks, workers pull + run multi-turn agent
loops (call the calculator, see the result, answer), and ``generate`` returns a flat
``List[Sample]`` of variable-depth trajectories.

    QWEN3_INSTRUCT_PATH=/root/unirl/models/local/Qwen3-4B-Instruct \
    AGENTIC_NUM_GPUS=2 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 .venv-sglang/bin/python scripts/agentic_engine_smoke.py

Exits 0 on PASS, non-zero on failure. GPU-only (needs ≥2 visible GPUs + a model).
