"""Shared sharded-weight loader for the FSDP and VeOmni backends.

Both backends materialize a meta-built, FSDP2-sharded trainable module and
broadcast real weights into it from rank 0.  The mechanics are identical — the
only backend difference is *timing*: VeOmni's ``parallelize`` already
``to_empty``-materializes the module before this runs, while FSDP's wrap leaves
it on meta.  :func:`_load_state_dict_sharded`'s meta-gate absorbs that
difference (it ``to_empty``s only if params are still on meta), so the same
loader is correct on both.

This module imports ``torch`` / ``safetensors`` at module level and MUST stay
out of the ``veomni`` package's import graph — it is imported only from inside
``backend.py`` — so the selective-import audit (``tests/test_compat_import.py``)
and the torch-free package-import check (``tests/test_recipe_compose.py``) stay
green.
