"""Meta-init support for bundles feeding :class:`VeOmniBackend`.

A transformer built under ``torch.device("meta")`` and later materialized by
``to_empty()`` loses every tensor that checkpoints don't carry:

* **non-persistent registered buffers** (in ``named_buffers()`` but not in
  ``state_dict()``) — e.g. diffusers ``PatchEmbed.pos_embed`` sincos tables;
* **plain tensor attributes** in a module's ``__dict__`` — e.g. Qwen-Image's
  complex rope tables (deliberately not buffers upstream).

:func:`stamp_init_state_restore` captures that init-computed state directly
from the freshly-built model — which must be built under
``accelerate.init_empty_weights(include_buffers=False)`` so its parameters
land on meta while its buffers / ``__dict__`` tensors stay real on CPU — and
stamps a deferred op (the ``unirl.train.deferred`` contract) that restores it
onto the materialized module. The backend drains it via ``apply_deferred_ops``
*after* the post-parallelize weight load, so persistent weights and
init-computed state never clobber each other.
