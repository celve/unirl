"""BatchManager — batch-granular async rollout over a single-turn engine slab.

One ``submit`` is one non-blocking distributed ``generate``: a batch IS one logical
unit, so its all-or-nothing completion is the right semantics and it stays on the
slab-wide ``Handle.launch_nowait`` path. ``(weight_version, gen_id)`` are stamped at
LAUNCH. Moved verbatim from the former ``engine/asynchronous.py``.
