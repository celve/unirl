"""AgenticManager — trajectory-granular driver-side rollout manager.

Sits over the ``AgenticRolloutEngine`` rank-0 coordinator and normalizes its
BROADCAST+RANK_ZERO returns (every value unwraps ``[0]``). Groups are stamped at
COMPLETION: ``weight_version`` is the counter when a root's last sibling lands,
``gen_id`` a monotonic completed-group counter. The per-turn version spread inside a
carried trajectory is corrected per-token by each gen Part's own ``weight_version``.

Moved verbatim from ``engine/asynchronous.py``; renamed because it holds no model and
cannot generate, so calling it an engine was misleading.
