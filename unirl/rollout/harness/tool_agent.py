"""ToolAgentHarness — the environment-driven multi-turn agent loop (LIN-492/531).

The task-semantics half of what ``AgenticRolloutEngine._run_one`` used to
inline (and the successor of the deleted ``AgentLoop`` prototype): each
turn forks a one-sample continuation, the ``"policy"`` engine fills it, and
the ENVIRONMENT decides what happens next — it parses the model's output
(e.g. a tool call), returns an observation that re-enters the chain as a
mask-0 input Part, and signals ``done``. The loop holds no other control
decision; queueing, concurrency, buffers, and abort belong to the hosting
runtime.

Suspension is checked at the top of each turn, so an in-flight turn always
finishes naturally before the partial trace is returned.
