"""The harness boundary: what a task-internal control flow may see and return.

Kept deliberately narrow. The vocabulary test is the guard: nothing here may
speak trainer words (``rollout_id`` / ``sync_interval`` / rewards scoring /
GRPO grouping / checkpoint cadence) or deployment words (wake/sleep/offload —
engine residency is the hosting runtime's job, applied at ``generate``
boundaries per deployment, so the same harness runs colocate, separate, or
trainside unchanged).
