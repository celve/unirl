"""Driver-side batch rollout engine and its mechanisms (LIN-631).

The async half of the engine design: ``synchronous.py`` records the worker-side sync
contracts (``BaseRolloutEngine`` / ``SyncRolloutEngine``); this module records
the driver side — everything is single-threaded, lock-free, and ray-free
(non-blocking dispatch is ``Handle.launch_nowait``).

Mechanisms (policy-free — launch ceilings, reap/launch ordering, and step
loops live in the trainers):

- :class:`VersionedBuffer` — payload-agnostic freshness/staleness buffer.
- :class:`InflightPool` — non-blocking pool of distributed ``generate`` calls.

``AsyncBatchRolloutEngine`` launches one slab-wide batch per submission and
exposes ``poll`` / ``drain_freshest`` / ``pop_evicted`` / ``quiesce`` plus an
engine-owned weight-version counter. Agentic trajectory scheduling lives in
``unirl.rollout.manager`` instead.
