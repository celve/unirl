"""AgenticRolloutEngine — multi-turn (agentic) rollout over a rank-0 coordinator (LIN-522, LIN-531).

See ``docs/async-rollout-service-design.md`` and ``docs/partial-rollout-design.md``. The engine is a
``BaseRolloutEngine`` on a DP-replicated slab. Each worker builds its **own local** inner single-turn
engine + environment (the ``ComposedRolloutEngine`` build-inner pattern) and runs **one persistent drain
loop** that pulls single-trajectory tasks from a central queue and runs each as a multi-turn agent loop
on the inner engine's event loop.

**Partial rollout interface (LIN-531).** The engine is the *mechanism*; the trainer owns the *policy*
(how many to over-sample, staleness, when to sync). The coordinator exposes a
**submit / poll / abort** interface over a **background** drain the trainer reaps and interrupts:

- ``submit(request)`` — enqueue a pool (fresh prompts and/or carried partials) and fire the drain
  **non-blocking**; the trainer reaps completions with ``poll`` and cuts the tail with ``abort``.
- ``poll()`` — the trajectories **completed since the last poll** (aggregated across workers).
- ``abort()`` — a **turn-boundary** stop: workers stop pulling and checkpoint their in-flight
  trajectories at the next turn boundary; returns the carried set (in-flight partials + not-started
  tasks). After it returns the inner engine is **decode-idle** → safe for the trainer to weight-sync.
- ``generate(request)`` — a thin *barrier* convenience (submit + drain-to-completion) kept for the
  colocate/``partial_rollout=false`` path, byte-identical to the pre-partial-rollout behaviour.

Two roles, one class:

- **Coordinator = rank 0** (``set_workers`` + ``submit``/``poll``/``abort``/``generate``,
  ``BROADCAST + RANK_ZERO``): rank 0 fans the batch into ``n × P`` single-trajectory tasks, fires one
  ``run_drain`` per worker (raw ``Worker.call``), serves ``next_task`` pulls, and aggregates the
  per-worker completed/carried buffers.
- **Worker = every instance** (``run_drain`` / ``_drain`` / ``_run_one`` / ``_pull`` + the un-decorated
  control methods ``drain_completed``/``collect_carried``/``set_stopping``/``reset_round``): the
  persistent drain loop is the always-on driver of the inner engine's loop; the control methods ride the
  threaded Worker (``worker_max_concurrency>1``) alongside the running drain.

Weight sync is unchanged (design §8): the trainer quiesces the rollout (``abort`` — turn-boundary
checkpoint, or the ``generate`` barrier) and syncs *between* drives; ``run_drain`` holds the inner
backend's loop-lock for the drive. Delegated verbs below forward to the inner engine.
