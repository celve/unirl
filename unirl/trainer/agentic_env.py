"""AgenticEnvTrainer — agentic multi-turn RL with ENV-SOURCED rewards (LIN-519).

A thin subclass of :class:`~unirl.trainer.agentic.AgenticTrainer` for
interactive ENVIRONMENTS (ALFWorld, Sokoban, WebShop, …) where the reward is the
environment's return per trajectory — the simulator's task-success / shaped signal,
already attached to each trajectory's last generated Part by the
:class:`~unirl.rollout.engine.agentic.engine.AgenticRolloutEngine` — not a grade of a
final ``<answer>``.

Only the reward SOURCE differs from the base ``AgenticTrainer``: this reads the
per-trajectory reward off the frontier instead of building a scoring Sample and
calling the reward backend (``RewardService`` even rejects precomputed rewards). The
GRPO tail — group-relative advantage → ``Part.concat`` of every assistant turn → one
on-policy ``train_track`` — is inherited unchanged, so ``ratio≈1`` and the
learn-from-all-turns behavior hold exactly as validated for the deep-research task.
