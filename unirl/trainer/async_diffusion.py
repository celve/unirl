"""Async diffusion RL trainer — disaggregated train/rollout slabs for DiT.

Diffusion sibling of :class:`~unirl.trainer.async_ar.AsyncARTrainer`. It subclasses
:class:`~unirl.trainer.diffusion.DiffusionTrainer` with ``layout="separate"`` to
REUSE its two-slab build (train slab + dedicated rollout engine slab), the
cross-slab weight-sync wiring (``RemoteLoraWeightSync`` for the BAGEL recipe;
``NCCLWeightSync`` is also supported by ``_connect_separate``) and the diffusion
plumbing (``_build_request_sample`` / ``_drop_decoded`` / ``evaluate`` /
checkpoint / FlowGRPO ``stack.train_track``).

The async loop runs over the shared
:class:`~unirl.rollout.manager.BatchManager` (the same engine
``AsyncARTrainer`` drives) — one single-threaded driver loop over non-blocking
Ray dispatch, no producer thread and no locks. This trainer supplies only the
diffusion hooks:

* ``_build_async_sample`` — one data batch → one request ``Sample``.
* ``_score_completed`` — reward at reap time, then split into tree-complete
  groups. Generation overlaps training; reward scoring itself does not.
* ``_advantage_and_train`` — advantage + FlowGRPO optimizer step over the
  freshest ``batch_size`` groups; it never calls the reward.

Two numeric knobs (identical semantics to AsyncARTrainer):
  * ``max_inflight`` — must be ``1`` so a reap-time transfer never competes with
    a queued generation on the rollout workers.
  * ``buffer_max_staleness`` — regular rollout-weight syncs a buffered group may
    cross. ``0`` (default) never crosses a sync; ``>0`` enables a bounded
    policy-lag buffer.

``_next_step`` polls (reaps) BEFORE topping up launches, which is what makes the
overlap fast here: reaping a generation pulls its trajectory segment off the
rollout slab (the reward's cross-slab localize, an NCCL send issued on the
rollout workers), so a generation launched ahead of that send blocks it —
measured ~150s/rollout on BAGEL instead of ~8s. Reaping first hands the send
idle workers, and the launch that follows still happens before the step returns,
so the next generation overlaps this step's training.

Draining all in-flight generations before each weight sync is MANDATORY (a
weight + KV update corrupts an in-flight generation); that is the
single-threaded ``_drain_all`` quiesce.
